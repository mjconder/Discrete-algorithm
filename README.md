# Discrete algorithm

The following is an implementation in Magma of an algorithm described in [1]. It takes as input two elements A and B of SL(2,Q_p) (where Q_p denotes the p-adic numbers) and determines whether or not the corresponding subgroup G=<A,B> of PSL(2,Q_p) is discrete. We also include specific examples of each class in our classification.
